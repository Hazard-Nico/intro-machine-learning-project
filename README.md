# Intro to Machine Learning Project

## Description
This repository serves as a comprehensive introduction to machine learning concepts and techniques through a hands-on project. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to refresh their understanding of machine learning fundamentals, this project provides a structured approach to learning and implementing various algorithms.
This dataset using Medical Cost Personal Health Insurance

## Dataset Overview

The Health Insurance dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' health and insurance-related attributes. Below is a brief overview of the dataset columns:

- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Sex**: Gender of the individual (Male/Female).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Children**: Number of children/dependents covered by health insurance.
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker or not (Yes/No).
- **Region**: Geographic region of the individual (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest).
- **Charges**: Medical insurance costs billed by the insurance company.

The goal of this project is to predict health insurance charges based on the given attributes using machine learning techniques.

## Results

The project repository contains the following key results and findings:

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features to prepare it for model training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Extensive exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations and statistical summaries were utilized to understand the distribution of variables, relationships between features, and potential patterns.

3. **Model Building**: Various machine learning algorithms were implemented, including linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM), to predict health insurance charges. Each model was trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques, such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

4. **Evaluation**: The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared score, and mean absolute error (MAE). This allowed for comparison of the effectiveness of different algorithms in predicting health insurance charges. We choose the Ensemble boosting too, which is Ridge Regressor

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the evaluation results, insights were drawn regarding the most effective algorithms for predicting health insurance charges. Suggestions for further improvements or areas of exploration were also discussed.
